- filter_cells → filter cells by number of genes - filter_genes → filter genes by number of cells

- sc.pp.filter_genes(adata, min_cells=3);sc.pp.filter_cells(adata, min_genes=200)

- UAMP in single cell analysis- visualize high dimensional data

- PCA vs UAMP
- UAMP captures non linear relations while PCA is for linear

- Leidein clustering in scanpy workflow
- to detect groups of similar cells based on shared gene expression
