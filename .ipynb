To mt_genes = fresh_blood_adata.var[fresh_blood_adata.var['MT']]
This keeps only rows where the "MT" column is True. Based on your table, the columns present are:
•	gene_ids
•	feature_types
•	genome
•	MT
•	RIBO
•	HB
And the filtered genes are all prefixed with MT-, which are canonical mitochondrial genes in the human genome. This is a common operation in single-cell RNA-seq QC pipelines to, for example, calculate per-cell mitochondrial transcript fractions.
To summarize:
•	The command gives you a subset of features (genes) where the 'MT' flag is True.
•	This is useful if you want to quantify mitochondrial gene expression in your dataset (an important quality control metric).
Tip:
If you want to get the list of names or gene IDs, you can use:
Python
mt_gene_names = mt_genes.index.tolist()
# or for gene_ids field:
mt_gene_ids = mt_genes['gene_ids'].tolist()
